Suru Icon Theme
================

Suru is a FreeDesktop icon theme whose design is based upon and around the Suru icon guidelines for Ubuntu mobile applications.

Many of the original Ubuntu generic app icons and Unity8 symbolic icons have been repurposed for desktop use, however the icon set has extensive additions such as icons for folders, devices, file types, application categories, and other system toolbar and status icons.

## Notes

 - This set is designed for desktop environment coverage only, pull requests or issues regarding branded icons or theming third-party applications (for example, Firefox) will be rejected.
 - Any issues or pull requests regarding icons specifically for desktop environments, such as MATE, XFCE, etc., will be attended to as they come.
 - A theme that includes icons for third-party apps and branded icons is under development but is separate from this set.
